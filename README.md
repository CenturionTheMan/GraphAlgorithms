# Graph Algorithms
This project was made for university purposes.

It implements the following graph representations:
* Adjacency Matrix
* Adjacency List

These representations are later used for:
* MST algorithms:
  * Prim's algorithm
  * Kruskal's algorithm
* Shortest path algorithms:
  * Dijkstra's algorithm
  * Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm

It also conducts time tests in order to analyze the time complexity of each graph/algorithm combination.

The results are presented in Polish in the report.
